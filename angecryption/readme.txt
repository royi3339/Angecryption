welcome to royi-angecryption system!!!

I built 3 types of system that perform a "angecryption".

in every angecryption option, you can find a readme file that describe what special/different in it.

note that the "angecryption option 2" and the "angecryption option 3", almost the same code!!! - that because
angecryption option 2 - perform a "regular" - encrypt and then decrypt
angecryption option 3 - perform a "reversed" - decrypt insted of encrypt, and encrypt insted of decrypt, because of the (iv problem of the first block of the decryption...)

the Cryptography method that used for the encrypt/decrypt: AES-CBC


thanks, and have a fun.
