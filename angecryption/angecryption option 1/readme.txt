
in this version we can combine 2 files in 1 png file - encrypted or not...

in not encrypted angecrypted file - we can easily change the file type in order to get the second file...
in ecrypted angecrypted file - we will need the key to get the second hidden file.


the most complete advantage of this version - we can hide any file we want in a png file !!!
the disadvantage of this version - we can hide files only in a png file.


thos are the file types that the program support and can hide in a png file: (which known for now...)
	.mp3
	.png
	.rar
	.zip
	.pdf

that mean that we can add to a zip/rar what ever we want (.mp4, .exe, .doc, .pptx, etc) and continue with that zip/rar file and the program will run perfect...


requires:
need to download: pycryptodome library.
